# Multi-user SPLOT

Multi-SPLOT is a Configuration System that supports simultaneous decisions from multiple users.

> Nowadays, companies have gone from offering a
> single product for all their clients, to offer different customized
> for each one.
> These companies provide Configuration Systems
> where a user can decide and discard which features she wants
> in her final product. However, although these systems support
> individual decisions, they do not offer an special support for
> decisions made by multiple users for the same product.



This system uses offthe-shelf solvers to determine if these decisions are not conflicting among them, and to propose solutions when the decisions of an
user conflict with decisions of the others.
