# Multi-user SPLOT

Application for configuring feature models by multiple users.

> Nowadays, companies have gone from offering a
> single product for all their clients, to offer different customized
> for each one. These companies provide Configuration Systems
> where a user can decide and discard which features she wants
> in her final product. However, although these systems support
> individual decisions, they do not offer an special support for
> decisions made by multiple users for the same product. This paper
> presents Multi-SPLOT, a Configuration System that supports
> simultaneous decisions from multiple users. This system uses offthe-shelf
> solvers to determine if these decisions are not conflicting
> among them, and to propose solutions when the decisions of an
> user conflict with decisions of the others. Our solution use
> Angular, Firebase and optimization library in Google App Script.
